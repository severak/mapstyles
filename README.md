# Sever√°k's map styles

Custom map styles for Openstreetmap. These were implemented using Mapbox Studio but Mapbox decided to remove their free tier. Now these will be ported to [Shortbread](https://shortbread-tiles.org/).

## status

I am porting these old styles to Shortbread. No public demo available yet.

## styles and other content

- Colorize - style based on Solarized color scheme and hatching patterns (see [legacy screenshots](colorize/legacy))
- CZMil - style inspired by Czech military maps (see [legacy screenshots](czmil/legacy))
- Metropolis - complex style for hiking and tourist guides, inspired by old Czech tourist maps (see [legacy screenshots](metropolis/legacy)), also ported to Mapsforge (see [screenshot](metropolis/legacy/mapsforge-metropolis.png))
- Piknik - first iteration of hiking style, implemented in Mapsforge (see [screenshot](piknik/mapsforge-piknik.png))
- Vicent - simple style focused on railways (see [legacy screenshots](vincent/legacy))
- ZM - an attempt to reproduce color schema used by Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping and Cadastre (works only in [ColorBook test tool](http://severak.github.io/colorbook/))

There is also semi usable map styling toolkit in folder `lualibs`.
